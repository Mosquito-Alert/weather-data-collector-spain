# - Municipal forecasts (7-day outlook)
# - All three core datasets updated daily

# EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
# - Duration: 4-6 hours (depending on API responsiveness)
# - Resources: 8GB memory, 2 CPUs
# - Success rate: ~95% with automatic API key rotation
# - Monitor integration: Real-time status updates
