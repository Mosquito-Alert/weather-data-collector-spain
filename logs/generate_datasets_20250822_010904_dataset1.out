> # -------------------------------
> # Purpose: Create daily aggregated weather data by station from hourly observations
> #
> # This script processes the hourly expanded weather data to create daily summaries
> # by station. It combines historical daily data with aggregated current observations
> # to provide a complete time series from 2013 to present.
> #
> # Output: Daily means, minimums, maximums, and totals by weather station
> #
> # Data Sources:
> #   1. Historical daily data (2013 to T-4 days) from AEMET climatological endpoint
> #   2. Current hourly data (T-4 days to present) aggregated to daily values
