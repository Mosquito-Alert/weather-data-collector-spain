> # get_latest_data_expanded.R
> # ----------------------
> # Purpose: Download and update the latest observation data from AEMET stations across Spain.
> #
> # This script fetches weather observations from the AEMET OpenData API using the 7 core variables
> # that are compatible across current observations, historical data, and forecast endpoints.
> #
> # Core Variables (Safe for all endpoints):
> #   - ta: Air temperature (°C)
> #   - tamax: Maximum temperature (°C) 
> #   - tamin: Minimum temperature (°C)
> #   - hr: Relative humidity (%)
> #   - prec: Precipitation (mm)
> #   - vv: Wind speed (km/h)
> #   - pres: Atmospheric pressure (hPa)
> #
> # Main Steps:
> #   1. Load dependencies and API key.
> #   2. Define functions to request and process data from the AEMET API, with error handling and retries.
> #   3. Download the latest data and reshape it for storage.
> #   4. Append new data to the local CSV file, ensuring no duplicates.
> #
> # Usage:
> #   - Requires a valid API key in 'auth/keys.R' as 'my_api_key'.
> #   - Run as an R script. Output is written to 'data/spain_weather_expanded.csv.gz'.
> #
> # Dependencies: tidyverse, lubridate, curl, jsonlite, data.table, R.utils
> #
> # Author: John Palmer
> # Date: 2025-08-20 (Updated for 7-variable expansion)
> 
> # Title ####
> # For downloading latest observation data from AEMET stations all over Spain. This needs to be run at least every 12 hours, but better to run it every 2 because of API limits, failures etc.
