> # get_historical_data.R
> # ----------------------
> # Purpose: Download and update historical daily weather data for Spain from the AEMET OpenData API.
> #
> # This script fetches historical daily climatological data using the 7 core variables
> # that are compatible across current observations, historical data, and forecast endpoints.
> #
> # Core Variables (Standardized):
> #   - ta: Air temperature (°C) - from tmed
> #   - tamax: Maximum temperature (°C) - from tmax 
> #   - tamin: Minimum temperature (°C) - from tmin
> #   - hr: Relative humidity (%) - from hrMedia
> #   - prec: Precipitation (mm) - from prec
> #   - vv: Wind speed (km/h) - from velmedia
> #   - pres: Atmospheric pressure (hPa) - from presMax
> #
> # Concurrency Control:
> #   - Set PREVENT_CONCURRENT_RUNS = TRUE to enable lockfile-based run prevention
> #   - Set PREVENT_CONCURRENT_RUNS = FALSE (default) to allow multiple concurrent runs
> #
> # Main Steps:
> #   1. Load dependencies and API key.
> #   2. Determine which dates are missing from the local dataset.
> #   3. Download missing data in chunks, handling API rate limits and errors.
> #   4. Append new data to the historical dataset.
> #
> # Usage:
> #   - Requires a valid API key in 'auth/keys.R' as 'my_api_key'.
> #   - Run as an R script. Output is written to 'data/output/daily_station_historical.csv.gz'.
> #
> # Dependencies: tidyverse, lubridate, data.table, curl, jsonlite
> #
> # Author: John Palmer
> # Date: 2025-08-22 (Updated for 7-variable standardization)
> 
> # Title ####
> # For downloading and preparing historical weather data.
