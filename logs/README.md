# Log Files

This directory contains log files and outputs generated by the weather data scripts. These files are useful for monitoring script execution, debugging, and auditing data updates.

## Files
- `get_latest_data.out` — Console output and logs from running `get_latest_data.R`. Includes timestamps, download status, and any errors or warnings encountered during the latest data fetch.
- `get_historical_data.out` — Console output and logs from running `get_historical_data.R`. Tracks progress, missing dates processed, and any issues during historical data updates.

## Usage
- Review these files after running scripts to check for errors, warnings, or successful completion.
- Log files are overwritten or appended to with each script run, depending on how the scripts are executed.
- These files are not intended for direct data analysis, but for operational monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Note
- Log files may grow large over time; consider archiving or cleaning up periodically.
- Sensitive information (such as API keys) should not appear in these logs, but always review before sharing.
